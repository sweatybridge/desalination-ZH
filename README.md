===============

An educational website on the state of desalination technology in Singapore. (Chinese content)

Brief History
=====

Back in the days when Flash was still the craze, I built this website as part of my research project for Chinese class. Apart from a few broken external links in the swf file (caused by stricter security settings in modern browsers), the website is in surprisingly good shape.

* `src` directory contains the source fla, psd, and various resources pulled off the internet.
* `dist` diretory contains the distributable files for the entire site.
